This project uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to detect players from two synchronized videos (broadcast and tacticam), assign consistent player IDs over time, and map players between views. It also provides visualizations of player trajectories and timelines.

ðŸ”§ Features

Player Detection using YOLOv8

Tracking: Assigns consistent IDs to players across frames

Player Mapping: Matches players between different camera views

Visual-Spatial Mapping: Trajectory plots for player movements

Temporal Mapping: Frame-wise appearance timelines

JSON Exports: Detections, paths, and mappings saved for external analysis
